# XAI

X.AI Corp., doing business as xAI, is an American startup company working in the area of artificial intelligence (AI). Founded by Elon Musk in March 2023, its stated goal is "to understand the true nature of the universe".


## History

xAI was founded by Musk in Nevada on March 9, 2023, and has since been headquartered in the San Francisco Bay Area in California.
Igor Babuschkin, formerly associated with Google's DeepMind unit, was recruited by Musk to be Chief Engineer.
Musk officially announced the formation of xAI on July 12, 2023. He linked the date (7 + 12 + 23 = 42) to the book The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy by Douglas Adams, in which a supercomputer calculates that the answer to the ultimate question of "life, the universe, and everything" is 42; and to the company's mission "to understand the universe".
In December 2023, in a U.S. Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) filing, xAI revealed that it had raised US$134.7 million in outside funding out of a total of up to $1 billion. Despite the filing, Musk later claimed via X that xAI was not seeking any funding.
In May 2024, xAI was reported to be looking for $6 billion of funding. Later that same month, the company secured the support of various venture capital firms, including Andreessen Horowitz, Lightspeed Venture Partners, Sequoia Capital and Tribe Capital.
In May 2024, Musk predicted that AI will make most jobs obsolete, requiring a high universal income.
In June 2024, the Greater Memphis Chamber announced xAI is planning on building Colossus, the world's largest supercomputer in Memphis, Tennessee. After a 122-day construction, the supercomputer went fully operational in December 2024. Local government in Memphis has voiced concerns regarding the increased usage of electricity, 150 megawatts of power at peak, and while the agreement with the city is being worked out, the company has deployed 14 VoltaGrid gas generators to temporarily enhance the power supply. Environmental advocates state that the gas-burning turbines emit large quantities of gases causing air pollution, and that xAI has been operating the turbines illegally without the necessary permits.
As of August 2024, Musk diverted a large number of Nvidia chips which had been ordered by Tesla, Inc. to X and xAI.
On December 23, 2024, xAI raised an additional $6 billion in a funding round supported by Fidelity, BlackRock, Sequoia Capital, among others, making its total funding over $12 billion.
