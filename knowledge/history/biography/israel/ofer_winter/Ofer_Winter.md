At the beginning of the operation, on July 9, 2014, a "Commander's Page for Battle" he wrote to the brigade's soldiers was published, in which, in addition to messages such as emphasizing mission accomplishment and defending the people and the homeland, he wrote:"The history has chosen us to be at the forefront of the fight against the fierce Gazan terrorist enemy, who defies, curses, and reviles the God of Israel's armies. I lift my eyes to the heavens and call with you, "Šəmaʿ Yīsrāʾēl Hashem ʾĕlōhēnū Hashemʾeḥād" O Lord, God of Israel, please make our path successful, as we go and stand to fight for Your people Israel against the enemy who blasphemes Your name."
The commander's page was published in the media and sparked a discussion about the place of religion and faith in the army.
During the operation, the brigade's fighters under his command killed many terrorists and uncovered and destroyed combat tunnels and infrastructure used by Hamas. The brigade played a central role in the Battle of Rafah. In a lecture he gave in 2021, he said he opposed the action that started the battle, as he believed the risk outweighed its benefit, but the Southern Command commander, Sami Turgeman, held a situation assessment and decided to carry it out.
In January 2015, following the dismissal of the Tzabar Battalion commander on suspicion of sexual harassment, the Chief of Staff, Benny Gantz, decided to issue him a command note, stating that "in this event, it was necessary to act according to the procedures and orders and to be familiar with them alongside the command handling."
